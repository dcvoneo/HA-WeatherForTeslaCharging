At 11pm I want to get a SUNSHINE forecast for the following day. Possibly in a few time periods.
Season will also depend on how much SOLAR power I can get.
If it is cloudy then fully charge the TESLA Powerwall during off peak 00.30 to 4.30am
If it is partialy cloudy charge the Powerwall acordingly off peak and allow the sun to top it up.
If it is sunny then charge the powerwall using solar.
